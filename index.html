                              The current cause of concern in India and across the world is the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus. The highly transmissible variant is also believed to be impervious to some vaccines and therapies, concerning the experts.

                              Delta Plus is a mutated form of the Delta variant, first found in India in December, 2020. So far, it has been detected in 12 states, according to the government and claimed nearly 50 lives.

                              But apart from this, there are other variants too which have the potential - though not as pronounced as Delta Plus - to infect the people and bring the economy back to a grinding halt.

                              According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the prominent variants of that coronavirus are: Alpha, Beta and Delta.

                      The first human cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, subsequently
                      named SARS-CoV-2 were first reported by officials in <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Wuhan City, China</span>, in December 2019. Retrospective
                      investigations by Chinese authorities have identified human cases with onset of symptoms in early December 2019.
                      While some of the earliest known cases had a link to a wholesale food market in Wuhan, some did not. Many of the
                      initial patients were either stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to this market. Environmental samples
                      taken from this market in December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the market in
                      Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak. The market
                      was closed on 1 January 2020

                      SARS-CoV-2 was identified in early January and its genetic sequence shared publicly on 11-12 January. The full
                      genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the early human cases and the sequences of many other virus isolated from
                      human cases from China and all over the world since then show that SARS-CoV-2 has an ecological origin in bat
                      populations. All available evidence to date suggests that the virus has a natural animal origin and is not a
                      manipulated or constructed virus. Many researchers have been able to look at the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2
                      and have found that evidence does not support that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct. If it were a constructed
                      virus, its genomic sequence would show a mix of known elements. This is not the case.

                      All the published genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human cases are very similar. This suggests that the
                      start of the outbreak resulted from a single point introduction in the human population around the time that the
                      virus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

                        </span>
                        is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.Currently, India has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia.[6] As of 12 June 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with 29.3 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 367,081 deaths.
                        The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan.
                        Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.[12] On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[13] Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.
                        Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.

                        A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much larger than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in parts of the country.[15] By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.
                        Health experts believe that India's figures have been underreported due to several factors.

                        On 14 April, Prime minister Narendra Modi extended the nationwide lockdown until 3 May, on written recommendation of governors and lieutenant governors of all the states, with a conditional relaxations after 20 April for the regions where the spread had been contained or was minimal.
                        On 1 May, the Government of India extended the nationwide lockdown further by two weeks until 17 May.
                        On 17 May, the lockdown was further extended till 31 May by the National Disaster Management Authority.
                        On 30 May, it was announced that lockdown restrictions were to be lifted from then onwards, while the ongoing lockdown would be further extended till 30 June for only the containment zones. Services would be resumed in a phased manner starting from 8 June. It was termed as "Unlock 1.0".

                            Under complete lockdown, less than a quarter of India's $2.8 trillion economic movement was functional.
                            Up to 53% of businesses in the country were projected to be significantly affected.

                        On 25th March, 2020, hoping to suppress the spread of the coronavirus, 
                        India began the world’s largest lockdown, affecting 1.3 billion people. However, the sudden move to close down all but essential services threw millions out of work and began a desperate exodus of migrant and day labourers out of the big cities and into the countryside to their home villages. The implementation of the lockdown left a lot to be desired. The period was wasted and not used to ramp up testing and other capacities. India is leading among all countries when it comes to the COVID-19 caseload.
                        We suddenly also notice the rush to make vaccines which will take at least 12 to 16 months to be ready.

                       Most tests for COVID-19 involve taking a swab sample from the back of the nose
                       ,throat or both.Some tests required blood sample.
                       These tests aim to find out if a person has, or has ever had, an infection
                       with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This virus that causes
                       coronavirus disease 19(COVID-19).
                                  A molecular or antigen test can tell whether a person currently has the infection
                        regardless of whether they have any symptoms.
                                   A serological or antibody test shows whether the body has antibodies
                        to the virus. It cannot show whether a person has an active infection.

                      When a virus is widely circulating in a population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases. The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more it replicates – and the more opportunities it has to undergo changes.
                      Most viral mutations have little to no impact on the virus’s ability to cause infections and disease. But depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect a virus’s properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more or less easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more or less severe disease).

                       <p class="answer">ans: A vaccine needs to pass through several stages of trails before the manufacturer
                         apply for approval. Vaccine trails involve a large no of people. At first, specific 
                         long term effects of any new medical treatment ,including a vaccine, are unknown.
                         The key is to balance the potential risks of getting vaccine that has undergone 
                         extensive testing with the known dangers of developing COVID-19.

                        very little data are available to assess vaccine safety in pregnancy. Pregnant women
                        may may receive the vaccine if the benefit of vaccinating a preganant woman outweights 
                        the potential vaccine risks.

                      component of the vaccine should not take it. The vaccine has been tested in children above
                      16 years of age. Therefore, at this time, WHO does not recommend vaccinantion of children 
                      below 16 years of age, even if they belong to high-risk group.

                    <p class="answer">ans: A protective effect starts to develop 12 days after the irst dose, but full
                      protection requires two doses which WHO recommends be administered with a 21 to 28 day interval.
                      Additional research is needed to understand longer term potential protection after single dose, If 
                      you are getting COVAXIN, then second dose should be taken within 4 to 6 weeks. If you are getting
                      COVISHIELD, the second dose should be taken in 4 to 8 weeks.
